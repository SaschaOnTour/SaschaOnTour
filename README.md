# 👋 Hello, World!

### *I'm Sascha — Principal Developer with 35+ years of passion for code* 🚀

**Backend Enthusiast** with roots in microcontroller programming 🔧

## About Me

My programming journey began at age 10, tinkering with microcontrollers and discovering that a few lines of code could make things come alive. That spark of fascination has never faded — over three decades later, I'm still driven by the same thing that hooked me as a kid: with code, almost anything is possible. There's always a new problem to solve, a better approach to find, a system to improve. No standstill, just constant evolution.

Over the years, I've worked my way through quite a few languages and paradigms. It all started at the lowest level — machine code and assembly, talking directly to hardware. From there, I moved through Basic, Pascal/Delphi, and into C and C++ territory. Eventually, Java and C# became my daily companions, and more recently Kotlin joined the mix. Right now, I'm particularly excited about Rust and the doors it opens for safe, performant systems programming.

One of the highlights of my career was contributing to **OpenOffice Calc** as a developer at **Sun Microsystems** — an experience that shaped how I think about large-scale software and open-source collaboration. Along the way, I also completed a Computer Science degree at FernUniversität in Hagen while simultaneously doing a formal apprenticeship as a certified software developer — because apparently one qualification at a time wasn't enough for me.

## I'm a Backend Developer.

The backend is where I feel at home. I love designing robust systems, crafting clean architectures, and writing performant code that just works — reliably, at scale, and under pressure. Whether it's enterprise applications in C# and Java or pushing the boundaries with Rust, I'm most comfortable where the logic lives and the real complexity hides behind the scenes.

## Why Open Source, Why Now?

For most of my career, I kept my head down in proprietary codebases — not because I didn't believe in open source, but because I simply never made the time for it. That's changing now. Over the years, I've watched the importance of open source grow far beyond just sharing code. In a world where privacy is increasingly eroded, where software becomes more opaque and users have less and less control over the tools they depend on, open-source development isn't just a nice thing to do — it's becoming essential. Transparent software is trustworthy software, and I want to be part of building that. Better late than never.
